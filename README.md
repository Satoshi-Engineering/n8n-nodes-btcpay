    * **View stores** (`btcpay.store.canviewstoresettings`) â†’ Required for all nodes.
    * **Modify store webhooks** (`btcpay.store.webhooks.canmodifywebhooks`) â†’ Required for the trigger node.
    * **View payment requests** (`btcpay.store.canviewpaymentrequests`) â†’ Needed for the get operation.
    * **Modify payment requests** (`btcpay.store.canmodifypaymentrequests`) â†’ Needed for the create operation.

### Adding Credentials to n8n

1. Once your API key is generated, locate it in the table and click **Reveal** under the `Key` column.
2. Copy the API key and go to your n8n instance.
3. Navigate to `/home/credentials` and create new credentials for BTCPay.
4. Select BTCPay API, then:

    * Paste the API key in the **API Token** field.
    * Enter the host URL of your BTCPay server (including protocol and port).
